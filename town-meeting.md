# About me

Hi — I'm Jon.

I've lived in Brookline since 2003, when my wife Sarah and I married and found our first apartment on Beacon Street. Both having grown up in Route 128 suburbs, we were eager to live our lives closer to the city. Then as today, Brookline offers the ideal balance.

In 2012, we moved to Gardner Road and Precinct 12.

I lead the user experience design team at a healthcare technology company in Boston, and Sarah is an anesthesiologist at a community hospital in Milford. We have three children — ages 15, 11, and 9 — who are all devoted aficionados of Brookline's many parks and baseball fields.

We are active members of the Young Israel of Brookline, where I'm currently a board member and frequent volunteer. I also serve as associate vice president for the National Council of Young Israel, where I've helped make the organization more transparent, more accountable, and less politically polarizing.

# A design mindset

In my profession, I work with colleagues to understand a project's **goals and constraints**, and then I help our team generate **a range of design solutions** that we can iteratively refine.

We start with primary field research to see problems first-hand and we end with field testing to evaluate whether our solutions will work.

I hope to contribute that kind of design-thinking approach to any of the challenges that face our town.

# How might we...

## ...lower the cost of market-rate housing?

Over nearly 20 years, we've seen most of our original Brookline friends leave town because they couldn't afford a home, or there simply weren't any suitable homes on the market. If Brookline's current path continues, there's no rational way our children will afford a life in Brookline as adults.

* Simplify the rules for adding accesory dwelling units (ADUs)
* Remove outdated legal barriers to transit-oriented housing development

## ...make walking and biking safer?

## ...locate more of our own businesses near home?

Before COVID, the startup I work for found new office space every year or two as we grew. Most years, a sizeable chunk of the company lived along the Green Line, but Brookline was never seen as an option — unlike Cambridge, Newton, and Boston, Brookline didn't have any startup-friendly office space.

* Take a transit-oriented approach to building more office space.
* Incentivize long-time owners of one-story commercial buildings to add office space above.
* Use increased commercial development to relieve some of the residential property tax burden.

## ...keep neighborhoods quieter for working at home?

Until more of us return to an office, though, we ought to think about whether our neighborhoods are adapted for working from home. Unless your home has thick walls and sturdy windows, our workday quiet in the spring, summer, or fall is regularly interrupted by landscapers' lawn-mowers and leaf-blowers.

* Less grass: encourage residential transitions to native perennial plants that don't require mowing
* More composting: incentivize home composting of yard waste rather than hauling it elsewhere
* Stricter decibel limits on lawn equipment (rakes are pretty quiet!)
