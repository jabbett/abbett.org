Hi, I'm Jon.

Since 1985, I've had a computer.

Since 1996, I've been building web sites.

Since 1999, I've been building web applications.

Since 2002, I've been building and designing healthcare software.

Since 2003, I've been married to a talented physician and accomplished healthcare leader.

Since 2004, I've dabbled in kosher cheesemaking.

Since 2006, I've been a father&mdash;now to three loving and clever boys.

Since 2013, I've been an inconsistently successful home vegetable gardener.

Between it all, I've also enjoyed cooking, print design and typography.
