Hi, I'm Jon. I live in Brookline, Massachusetts and I design healthcare software for a living.

I feel I owe my career to a visionary act of kindness.

In 1985, my grandmother had a stroke and my mother needed to care for her. An administrative assistant at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, my mother explained the situation to her boss, Dr. Marvin Zelen (["a giant in the field of biostatistics"](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/in-memoriam-prof-marvin-zelen-a-tremendous-force-in-biostatistics/)). In response, he offered my mother the flexibility to work from home as well as the computer equipment to make it possible — decades before it was commonplace, certainly for folks who were low in the office hierarchy.

Our family received an IBM PC-XT with a 40MB hard drive, color monitor, and a modem — thousands of dollars of equipment. My mother kept her job, took care of me and my grandmother, and gave me an opportunity to learn how to use a computer.

My mother spent the rest of her career with the Department of Biostatistics, and I have many happy memories of the hardware, software, and skills I was exposed to through her office:

* WordPerfect (the first electronic "art" I ever created was using the "line drawing" mode, and I'm certain that my mother's use of the "reveal codes" feature sparked my interest in markup languages)
* [Aldus PageMaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSX0bM_-cVY) (loaded from a [Bernoulli cartridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_Box))
* Printing in color with an [HP pen plotter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtrIAGso1n0)
* IBM Selectric II typewriters
* Early "webcams" like the [Connectix QuickCam](https://wiki.preterhuman.net/Connectix_QuickCam)
* Document scanners
* E-mail (my mother had both internet & [bitnet](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28428/bitnet) addresses)
* Gopher (a text-based hypertext protocol)
* The world wide web (I created my first personal website on a DFCI server)
