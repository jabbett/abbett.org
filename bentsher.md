## Background

In high school, I got hooked on the Klezmatics &emdash; they [performed with
Itzhak Perlman on Great Performances](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266653/), and then I ran out to buy their latest album,
[_Jews with Horns_](https://klezmatics.com/klezmer-music/jews-with-horns/). In college, I enrolled in Yiddish 10A with Ellen Kelman, and,
lucky for me, she'd occasionally bring her guitar into class and teach us 
Yiddish folksongs.

There was something that struck me about Yiddish songs about shabbat and the holidays
that was different from traditional Hebrew _zemirot_: many of them were funny.
