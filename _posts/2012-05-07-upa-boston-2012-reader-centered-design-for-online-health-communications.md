_At the UPA Boston 2012 conference, the team from CommunicateHealth presented “Reader-Centered Design for Online Health Communications.”_

### CommunicateHealth

*   [Health education firm](http://twitter.com/communicatehlth), improve health literacy on the web, through best practices and research strategies
*   Served as lead writers and editors for HHS’s [Health Literacy Online](http://www.health.gov/healthliteracyonline/) guide. Took a lot of existing general-purpose best practices and research, infused with over 700 user interviews. See guide for more details than today’s talk can provide.

### Why worry about literacy?

*   Half of Americans have limited literacy skills: reading, comprehending information.
*   Health literacy even more of a problem: 9 in 10 have limited health literacy skills.
*   Not only in reading, but being able to use info they’re reading to improve their health, for behavior change.
*   Stress and sickness can make even cause difficulties for the literate 10%
*   (Technique: black out complex words to see what a low-literacy user would experience.)

*   **Users with limited literacy skills are willing to use the web, and able to accomplish tasks when apps are designed well**
*   All users benefit from improved readability. Time-on-task improves for all user groups when improvements are made, _especially high-literacy users_ (!!)

### Writing for action

*   Passive is “about asthma,” active is “prevent asthma attacks at home”
*   Focus on the reader’s behavior, and give them a useful instruction… “what’s the action I can take right away?”
*   Facts, demographics, “background information” might be interesting, but it’s not actionable.
*   In asthma example, talk about common causes of attacks that could be eliminated.
*   Also make it personable - talk about “your family”, making changes in “your home”; resonates with people

### Organize content

*   Labels are important for helping readers find content: use labels your users know
*   Use open card sorting so users can suggest the terms they’d use for content labels
*   Not “indoor air quality,” but maybe “healthy air”

### Reader-friendly web fonts

*   Until very recently, number of fonts to choose were limited (and many of the limited options were bad for reading)
*   Web fonts can be used widely now (cf Google Web Fonts), but how to choose the most readable?
*   Ask: who is audience? what reading problems or disabilities?
*   Choose something appropriate for your most challenged users, and it should scale to all others.
*   Default to sans-serif (though with proper treatment, serifs can work)
*   Use fonts with equal stroke width
*   Use medium letter width
*   Use fonts with open counter space (e.g. an “open” e, rather than a closed “e” as in Helvetica)
*   Use fonts with tall x-heights (“X” is closer to top of other letters)
*   Once you find a typeface with all these qualities, it’s helpful to find a font with multiple weights (e.g. Open Sans has light, medium, book, bold, heavy.)

### Using fonts in context

*   Test your fonts with real content
*   Users with limited skills will **skip over content** with dense walls of text, long sentences, long words, and paragraphs with more than three lines.
*   Sometimes you can take preexisting content and use type treatment alone to improve readability.
*   Keep body text from 16-20 pixels. But different fonts might have different qualities at same pixel-height.
*   Keep line length narrow, 9-12 words max (e.g. newspaper columns)
*   Use line height of 120-150% (some breathing room between lines)

### Create Visual Hierarchy

*   Properly styling headings and paragraphs, providing enough whitespace, all contributes to readability and overall feeling of comfort while reading
*   Add “at a glance” info at the top, so busy people don’t need to read paragraphs and paragraphs at the outset
