I've metricized (if that's a word) a helpful [recipe-tweet](https://twitter.com/JustSayXtian/status/1345599740512092160) from [@justsayxtian](https://twitter.com/JustSayXtian/) and adapted it to how I typically mix, rise, and braid [challah](/2020/05/recipe-challah/).

_Makes 3 medium loaves._

### Equipment

* Stand mixer with dough hook
* Baking sheet with parchment paper
* [Digital scale](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Scale-Bakers-KD8000-Weight/dp/B00VEKX35Y)
* Brush for egg wash
* Bench scraper to cut dough

### Dough

* 600g [King Arthur Organic White Whole Wheat Flour](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/king-arthur-100-organic-white-whole-wheat-flour-5-lb) (4 C)
* 37g Bob's Red Mill Wheat Gluten Flour (1/4 C)
* 10g potato starch (1 Tbsp.)
* 1 tsp. fine salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 90g honey granules (1/2 C)
* 210g warm water (1 C)
* 100g vegetable oil (1 C)

### Egg wash

* 1 egg white (reserved from above)
* Pinch salt
* 1 Tbsp cold water
* Optional topping like sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or ["everything" mix](https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/everything-bagel-topping-8-oz)

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, gluten, potato flour, and salt.
1. In bowl of a 6-quart stand mixer, combine water, yeast, eggs, yolks, and oil.
1. Add flour mixture. Using dough hook, mix on low speed for 5 minutes. (Dough may feel a little dry, but the flour will continue to absorb its liquid while it rises.)
1. Divide dough into 3 equal pieces (about 582 grams each). Place each piece in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours.
1. With each piece of dough, remove from bowl, divide into 4 pieces, and roll pieces into 10-inch ropes. Braid ropes tightly. Pinch ends and tuck under to neaten.
1. Place the 3 braided loaves onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise for 45 minutes (until increased by one-third).
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle and preheat oven to 325Â°F Convection.
1. Whisk egg white with salt and water. Brush egg mixture onto loaves. Coat thoroughly with seed topping if using.
1. Bake 25 minutes. Cool on wire rack.

Rising tip: Place the dough in an unheated oven with only the oven light on. That should provide just enough warmth to stimulate the yeast.
