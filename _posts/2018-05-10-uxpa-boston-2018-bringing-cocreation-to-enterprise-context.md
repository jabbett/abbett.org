* [Medium article](https://medium.com/logmein-design/using-co-design-to-evangelize-customer-empathy-bb0c0c3b1bf)

## What is co-creation?

* Joint creation of value between _company_ and _customer_, along with designers and researchers on the team

## Why? Some historical examples

* In 1990s, video games were eclipsing LEGO...
* Collaboration with MIT brought LEGO Mindstorm... interactive robots made with LEGO
  * Almost immediately, people created custom (unauthorized) code for robots
  * Management not expecting it... initial reaction was negative... ultimately opened up their codebase to customer collaboration
  * Now, LEGO encourages their fans to design new LEGO sets
* DHL (according to _Forbes_ magazine) 6,000 co-creation engagement
	* 87% in customer satisfaction
	* 97% on-time delivery performance

## Case 1: Customer empathy

* Increase empathy with customers among stakeholders
* Reflect on user needs, not just "what works for business"
* Co-design far more effective method than anything done before

### Seeing thinking

* Artifacts represent what customers are thinking
* Stakeholders can see, not just hear

### Messy process

* We don't usually communicate the messy parts of design thinking
* Can see how ideas evolved from ideas to wireframes to mockups

### Stories

* Lots of people had time with customers
* Collective voice + individual voices
* Everyone became an advocate

### Excites customers

* Customers learned how designers struggle with thinking
* Customers felt ownership, inspiration when their ideas were heard, incorporated


## Logistics: How to implement?

* [Co-Design Quick Start Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hbxr3njm15g1ixc/UXPA%20Co-Design%20Quick%20Start%20Guide.pdf?dl=0) (PDF download)

### When?

* At a generative stage
  * After determining what, at a high level, to build
  * Before relevant pieces of product are set

### Where?

* In a space that "works"
  * Where you can record/livestream what happens

### How?

* Keep asking questions, keep iterating on how
* Before the session...
  * Who facilitates?
  * Who are the participants?
    * What should their experience be like?
    * What will make them feel comfortable, etc.
* After the session...
  * Are we accomplishing our design needs?
  * What can we improve for next time?

## Case 2: Add structure to blue-sky scenarios

* Too much freedom can be a problem: few secondary resources for references
* Need to discover unknown unknowns
* Co-design can be particularly helpful here
* Product Manager: "Seems intense. What if co-design fails?"
  * Alternative was laundry list of ideas from designers, then customer survey
  * First time, did both at the same time... could compare and convince wider team
* People had easier time visualizing solution than verbalizing
  * Designer sketched out users' thoughts in real time
* Stakeholders all watched remotely (live)
  * They noted interesting stories, problems, solutions
* Ultimately, a shared understanding
  * Less ambiguity
  * Helped stakeholders rally around user needs
  * Connected blue-sky ideas to users' reality
  * Led to features we may have overlooked
* Obviously, not a 1-to-1 mapping between user idea and ultimate design
  * Some ideas/asks are limited to that one user's experience... some are generalizable to many

## Spread through their organization

* Captured visuals, media from a session... shared with organization... captured imagination
  * Curiousity around seeing a new technique
  * Artifacts colorful, unique
  * "Aha" moment seeing customer doing the design
  * Ultimately, a CEO shout-out about co-design
* Initially: 3 month timeline, shared session media afterwards, remote had technical issues
* Now: done in 3 weeks, live watching, including remote

## Case 3: Across functional silos

* Support website covers 15 LogMeIn products
* Teams don't talk to each other
* Co-creation for personalized support website brought all the partners together
  * Listen across product teams
  * See topic through multiple lenses
  * Share data
  * Design components to serve many needs of larger group
* Challenging to...
  * align design with business outcome
  * avoid "private agendas"

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

* Build empathy
* Align teams
* Facilitate collaboration
* Lower resistance to change
  * Low-fi deliverables make them more open to iteration, feedback
* Amplifies other research methods
  * Don't do this in a bubble!
  * Pre-testing to narrow down scope
  * Post-testing to validate with larger audiences

### Cons

* Time-consuming
  * Logistics, plus creating content to present
* Users may not be able to come up with solutions
* Users are not always right
  * Designers still necessary to translate their input into actionable direction
* People show up with pre-conceived ideas about what final outcome should be... need to manage for compromise

## Tips & Tricks

* Ideal for large revamps (not small features)... keep design at high level!
* Remote works!
* When you start seeing patterns, start from there (not from scratch every time)
