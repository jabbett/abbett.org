* Researchers cannot interview everyone...
  * but product managers, for example, already interact with customers
  * _How do we empower our colleagues to bring back findings & share?_
* Developed a workshop!
  * Used active learning
     * minimal lecturing
     * lots of group work
     * hands-on practice
  * Demonstrates that _research is a process_ and takes _practice_
* Workshop topics
	* Active Listening
	* Crafting Questions
	* Mitigating Bias (in asking questions, picking participating, analyzing data)
	* Analyzing Data
* Take-aways
  * Recognize when to interview
  * Craft effective questions
  * Develop trust with participants
     * e.g. not trying to evaluate them, or sell to them... trying to learn from them
  * How not to bias what people say
  * Engage like a researcher
  * Generate insights
  * Getting excited about research
* Types of interviews, depending on project lifecycle
  * Need discovery/validation
  * Concept discovery/validation
  * Product enhancement
* You can get deep qualitative data without statistical significance
  * 5-8 people
  * Use agencies or recruiters

## Pilot sessions

* Helped us better understand what activities worked, figure out timing
* Developed a book to take-away for reference later
* Larger group works really well
  * 30 people can collect a ton of data in a day
  * better for participants to analyze their own data
* `hypothesis -> research questions -> interview`
* lots of free space for people sit, mingle

## Lessons

* Use activities instead of lecture
* Provide lunch
* Share war stories... people love to hear researchers' experience
* Allow for constant Q&A
* Train others to run the workshop
* Document in a facilitator's guide
