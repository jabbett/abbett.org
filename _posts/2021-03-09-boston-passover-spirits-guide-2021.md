We're fortunate to have slightly more variety in kosher-for-Passover spirits these days, and some of our local liquor stores carry a few. Here's a summary of what I've found.

# Kashrut

Consult your local rabbinic authority about precise kashrut, as standards differ. I've included some notes with particular kinds of spirits.

# Purchasing

Most of the links below send you to Drizly, which delivers throughout the Boston area from local liquor stores -- the exact stores are listed with each product. You might save money by visiting the store and buying it directly instead. I've listed the stores with the most products at the bottom of this page.

## Tequila / Mezcal / Sotol

Many silver/blanco tequilas have been permissible for Passover without an explicit kosher symbol (see this [2020 Passover tequila list](http://www.kosherphoenix.org/index.php/passover/)). I have e-mailed KA Kosher to see if they have any updated advice.
