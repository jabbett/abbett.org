This recipe takes what I learned with [modernist pastrami]() and applies it
to [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's sous-vide corned beef](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/03/homemade-corned-beef-brisket-with-potatoes-cabbage-carrots-recipe.html) technique.

The challenge I'd previously faced with streamlining a sous-vide corned beef recipe
was the brining time, so I'd asked Kenji if I could vacuum-pack before brining
and then cook in the bag:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You’d end up with really salty beef that doesn’t retain moisture well because it isn’t fully cured.</p>&mdash; Kenji López-Alt (@kenjilopezalt) <a href="https://twitter.com/kenjilopezalt/status/989331616316051456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2018</a></blockquote>

However, that critique assumed that the dry brine contained more salt than
would be palatable. With [Greg Blonder's precision brining approach](https://genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/pastrami.html), you rub with
the total amount of salt you want in the meat. Problem potentially solved: I can salt-rub
the meat, vacuum-pack it with pickling spices, and cook in the same bag immediately
after curing.

Note: Below, I've converted Greg's salt measurements and Kenji's spice measurements
into grams, for easier multiplication with differently-sized meats. Use Prague
Powder in a ratio of 1 gram per pound, and salt in a ratio of 0.5 gram per pound.

* 7 lb. lightly trimmed flat-cut kosher brisket (ideally with some marbling)
* 7 g Prague Powder #2
* 3.5 g kosher salt
* 30 g brown sugar (about 2 Tbsp.)
* 14 g black peppercorns (about 2 Tbsp.)
* 17 g yellow mustard seeds (about 2 Tbsp.)
* 10 g coriander seeds (about 2 Tbsp.)
* 6 g allspice berries (about 1 Tbsp.)
* 5.5 g ground ginger (about 1 Tbsp.)
* 6 whole cloves
* 6 bay leaves, roughly torn

1. Combine Prague Powder and salt. Using 1/4 tsp. increments, sprinkle over the brisket (about 3 increments per side) and rub in thoroughly. Place rubbed brisket in
vacuum bag.
2. Combine remaining spices and pour into vacuum bag, distributing evenly
around brisket.
3. Vacuum-seal the brisket. Place in refrigerator and cure 24-48 hours.
4. With immersion circulator in an ample basin, heat water to 149°F / 65°C.
8. Place cured brisket in water bath. Cook for 48 hours.
9. Serve or chill.
