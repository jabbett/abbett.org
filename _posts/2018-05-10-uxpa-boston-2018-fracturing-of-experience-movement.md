* 30 years of consulting work, 30 years of running graduate/professional programs
* Curious about how design works in the public arena
* "Very disturbed by how I was taught design": observe practices, replicated, without understanding ideas behind
  * Graduate work, then, was in psychology
  * Pulling together what we call "UX" today
  * "At the right place at the right time"
* No matter what we've called it, we're "all about people"
* What keeps you awake at night? _Missing something significant in the marketplace_
  * A lot of changes over the years, timing is everything in graduate programs
* Was very excited to discover there was a behavior-driven approach to design in Norman's _Psychology of Everyday Things_ and Jonassen's _The Technology of Text_

## Our journey

* 1980: "Design of everything"
* Slow thirty-year focus on narrow confines of "product design"
* 2018: Gradual reemergence of "design of everything"
  * "Once you've done the bathroom experience, you've done it all."

## We've arrived

* We have the respect of business leaders, developers
* We apply our principles widely
* Number of practitioners explodes

## Success is not unnoticed

* Others want a piece of the action
* In some cases, want complete control of the experience

## "Fracturing"

* Customer experience
* Experience of place/community
* Patient experience
* Retail experience
* Service design
* Play/game design
* Design thinking

## A matter of "when"

* Momentum growing stronger over time
* Grad programs emerging... still a small number of programs
  * Leapfrogging over UX so they can place graduates more broadly
* Applicants already thinking about sub-specialization
* Consulting practices selling "experiences" (even though not using UX name)
* Human resources/hiring managers are asking about whether "UX" grad can fill a "Customer Experience" role

## Reject complacency

* 1990: Society for Technological Communication... sitting on top of the world... had respect...
  * Someone then was saying: "Here comes 'usability'... 70% of the documentation we write isn't going to be necessary."
* UPA was smart to move to UXPA

## Lose the "User" from UX?

* Names define/shape how others view us and what we do
* Does "user" limit us from greater opportunities?
* Consider "design thinking": would it be as successful if "user thinking"
* What about shift to "experience design"?
  * If we don't, will someone else?
  * Seeing this in graduate programs, at consulting practices

## If it's not broke?

* Disrupt, or be disrupted!

## Changing face of product design

* Interface is going away... nature of work is changing
* Product strategy, innovation is growing in importance

## Are we the only ones who'll suffer?

* Consider politics of product management
* Competition creates struggle for resources, power, control
* Will user/customer suffer?
