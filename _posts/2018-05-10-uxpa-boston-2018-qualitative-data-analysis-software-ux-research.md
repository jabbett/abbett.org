## Overview of software

* Capture the complete picture
* Find patterns and trends
* Some data is quantitative...
	* Task completion
	* Usability scores
	* Completed purchases
* ...but most UX research is qualitative
  * Emotional reactions
  * The "why" behind the data
  * Richer understanding of complexity
* QDAS helps you...
  * organize qual and match against the quant
  * incorporate media (photos, videos, transcripts, tweets)
  * look at data through different lenses
  * simplify storage/access to data
  * facilitate teamwork
  * help interpret through visualizations

## Why use?

* If you have longitudinal studies, are tracking users over time, and building upon research over time
* Analyze and synthesize large amounts of info with more rigor than paper
* Insights to build UX research deliverables come from many data sources, in many digital formats
* Easier to repurpose data for use in other project
* Paper has short shelf-life, destined for recycle bin
* Organize & code qualitative data, with easy access to primary source
* Start with paper (e.g. to do an affinity diagram) and then transfer to QDAS for permanent record

## Case study

* Field study to test media device in Mormon congregations worldwide
* Transcriptions into NVivo, coded
* Created info architecture of research, connected to primary sources
* Added annotations/reflections, to see thought process of research team over time
* Final analysis done in two days (rather than several weeks) because data was so well organized

## Key features

* Many vendors, pick one that best suits your project
* Code/tag data (e.g. tied to timestamp in audio/video)
  * Very powerful to hear people talk about issues in their own voices
  * Explore with text mining tools... word trees, word frequency, word cloud
* Organize (and later reorganize) codes/tags into relevant groupings
  * Organized codes become an outline that ultimately structures a research report (!)
* Crosstab query... e.g. see codes by demographic breakdown, then drill into source data
* Pull in data from social media...
  * geographic distribution
  * cluster analysis
  * sentiment analysis

## Questions

- distributed usage over the web?
- options for open source projects?
