Yields 24 latkes

*   2 lb. russet potatoes
*   1 medium onion, pureed (about 1 cup)
*   2 large egg
*   1 tsp. salt
*   1/2 cup flour (or matzo meal)
*   Pure olive oil for frying (not extra virgin)

Peel potatoes and shred in food processor (or, if appliance-challenged, with a box grater). Place potato shreds in a bowl and submerge in cold water for five minutes. Drain, then place in a clean kitchen towel, roll up, and twist forcefully to press juices out. (Use a kitchen towel you don’t like, as potato juice stains.) Set potato shreds aside.

If you are multiplying this recipe, keep the ingredients separated until ready to fry. Then, mix latke batter in single-recipe increments and fry (as described below), and repeat until completed.

Combine potato shreds, eggs, onion puree, salt, and flour — mix thoroughly.

In large skillet, heat 1/2 cup olive oil to 375-degrees. By heaping tablespoons, spoon batter into hot oil and press slightly into latke shape. Do not crowd the pan, as doing so will detrimentally lower the oil temperature — fry about five or six latkes at a time, depending on pan size. Cook five minutes, until brown on bottom, them flip and cook five minutes more. Place on paper towels to drain.

If you are multiplying this recipe, add more olive oil as necessary and be sure to maintain proper oil temperature. Also, you may need to add more flour (by the tablespoon) if the batter gets soggy.

If eating immediately, place drained latkes in a warm (250-degree) oven until ready to eat. If freezing, placed drained latkes in a storage container or foil tray, separating layers of latkes with wax paper, and freeze. To reheat, place latkes in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake at 350-degrees for 10-15 minutes until heated through.
