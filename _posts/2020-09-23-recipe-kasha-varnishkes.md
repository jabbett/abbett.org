No smell reminds me of Rosh Hashanah like _kasha varnishkes_.

---

_Serves 4-6 as a side dish._

### Ingredients

* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 C buckwheat groats, medium granulation
* 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil
* 1 C diced onion
* 2 C beef broth, hot
* 1 lb. bow-tie noodles (e.g. Barilla Farfalle)

1. Mix the beaten eggs and groats until egg is absorbed. Set aside.
1. In a large fry pan with lid, saute the diced onion in oil over medium-high heat until lightly browned.
1. Add the egg-groats mixture to the pan and toast until the granules look dry and separate.
1. Add the hot broth to the pan, cover, and lower heat to simmer.
1. Simmer for 10 minutes.
1. Cook noodles according to package directions.
1. Toss noodles with cooked buckwheat.

If you're feeling decadent, mix in some sauce and a little shredded meat from a recently braised brisket.
