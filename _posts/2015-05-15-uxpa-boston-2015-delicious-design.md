_Rachel Sengers and Jennifer Chaffee collaborate on IxD and Visual Design at Design for Context, and presented at UXPA Boston 2015. They specialize in complex transactional applications._

## “T-Shaped practitioner” proposed by IDEO

*   a core speciality + breadth across specialities
*   Lots of skills overlap between IxDs and Visual Designers.
*   If we collaborate, will have a stronger outcome.

## Creating a productive working arrangement

*   On each project, negotiate who’s going to do what
*   Know each other’s skills, preferences, career goals well
*   How can we help each other to facilitate other’s work?
*   Planning involves creative brief, user & business analysis, etc.

## Collaborating & iterating on wireframes

*   Identify patterns in the wireframes so that graphic design is most efficient
*   Will also simplify coding if consistent patterns are well mapped
*   Keeping patterns consistent make it easier to improve with better visual design after feedback
*   Conflict between too-similar affordances: Visual Designers have deep visual vocabulary to leverage in usability issues
*   Visual designer thrives on realistic content (lipsum text “doesn’t tell me anything”)
*   How does the content need to scale?
*   Show the content hierarchy so that visuals can reinforce it
*   Bring visual designer in early to develop a shared understanding
*   Without mental framework, hard to make design decisions
*   Annotate wireframes well, but don’t throw over the wall; conversation is key

## Facilitating change during visual design

*   IxD is in more user sessions, so it’s her responsibility to communicate to visual designer and be voice of user in critique
*   Don’t want the designer to simply color in shapes - need to enable opportunities for change
*   IxD should point out challenging areas to visual designer, inviting change
*   Point out areas that warrant extra design exploration
*   Also, point out “must be”s so it’s clear when something can’t change (and don’t need to waste time reinventing the wheel)
*   Often problem can be solved visually rather than with interaction or placement
*   Focus on key screens when time/budget is tight

## Creating a collaborative environment

*   Support exploration, sharing ideas, solving problems, reviewing work in progress, and create new ideas
*   Can be real or virtual environment
*   Use GoToMeeting to work remotely together
*   Helps to provide rationale for visual design decisions (again, no throwing over the wall)
*   Will explain color, typography, imagery, layout
*   Rationale deters subjective responses
*   Good to know what’s been tried and what didn’t work
*   In critique, make sure that what is working doesn’t get washed out by what still needs improvement
*   Review planning documents to make sure that you’re still on track
