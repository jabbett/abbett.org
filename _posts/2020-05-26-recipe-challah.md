This is my adaptation of the challah recipe from _The New Best Recipe_. I've made it pareve, because what good is a dairy challah recipe? I've adjusted it to make 3 medium-sized loaves with a simpler braid -- our family of five eats one per Shabbat meal. Finally, I've worked on the flavor, texture, and bake time so it's tasty the next day, too.

_Makes 3 loaves._

### Equipment

* Stand mixer with dough hook
* Baking sheet with parchment paper
* Digital scale
* Brush for egg wash
* Bench scraper to cut dough

### Dough

* 910g bread flour

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, yeast, honey granules, and salt.
1. In bowl of 6-quart stand mixer, combine eggs, yolks, oil, and water.
