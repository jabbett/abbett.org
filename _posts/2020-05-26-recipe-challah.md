_Revised June 2020_

This is my adaptation of the challah recipe from _The New Best Recipe_. I've made it pareve, because a dairy challah isn't useful for us. I've adjusted it to make 3 medium-sized loaves with a simple, 4-strand braid. Finally, I've worked on the flavor,
texture, and bake time so it's tasty the next day, too.

_Makes 3 8-inch loaves._

### Equipment

* Stand mixer with dough hook
* Baking sheet with parchment paper
* [Digital scale](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Scale-Bakers-KD8000-Weight/dp/B00VEKX35Y)
* Brush for egg wash
* Bench scraper to cut dough

### Dough

* 910g [King Arthur Organic Bread Flour](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/king-arthur-organic-bread-flour-5-lb)
* 5 tsp. yeast
* 100g honey granules or sugar (2/3 C)
* 2 1/2 tsp. fine salt
* 4 large eggs
* 2 large egg yolks
* 105g vegetable oil (1/2 C)
* 205g water (1 C)

### Egg wash

* 1 egg white (reserved from above)
* Pinch salt
* 1 Tbsp cold water
* Optional topping like sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or ["everything" mix](https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/everything-bagel-topping-8-oz)

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, yeast, honey granules, and salt.
1. In bowl of 6-quart stand mixer, combine eggs, yolks, oil, and water.
1. Add flour mixture. Using dough hook, mix on low speed for 5 minutes. Dough should clear the sides, but will stick to the bottom.
1. Divide dough into 3 equals pieces (about 515 grams each). Place each piece in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours.
1. Press dough gently to deflate. Let rise another 40&ndash;60 minutes.
1. With each piece of dough, remove from bowl, divide into 4 pieces, and roll pieces into 10-inch ropes. Braid ropes tightly (see below). Pinch ends and tuck under to neaten.
1. Place the 3 braided loaves onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise for 45 minutes (until increased by one-third).
1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle and preheat oven to 325°F Convection.
1. Whisk egg white with salt and water. Brush egg mixture onto loaves. Coat thoroughly with seed topping if using.
1. Bake 25 minutes. Cool on wire rack.

_Note: If you don't have a convection oven, you can bake at 350°F for 30 minutes, but the loaf in the middle may be a little under-baked._

### Braiding technique

![Challah dough, braided](/assets/images/challah_braided.jpg)

A simple three-strand braid works fine, but the loaves are a bit flat. I've learned a four-strand braid that's easy for me and gives the loaves more height.

* Pinch your four strands together at one end, and fan the strands out. Number the strand positions in your mind: 1, 2, 3, and 4.
* Whenever you move a strand it assumes the number of its new position.
* Braid in this pattern: **4-over-2, 1-over-3, 2-over-3**
* Repeat until you can't anymore, then pinch the ends together and fold under a bit to neaten.
