We’ve been making this recipe, adapted from the New York Times Passover Cookbook, page 268, for at least the last five years. It’s a nice departure from the typical dry Passover cakes, and especially suited to families who prefer apple desserts. The apples stay relatively crisp, and the eggs give a nice custardy taste and texture. Add half a cup of chopped walnuts if you like a little texture.

_8 servings_

*   margarine for greasing
*   4 sheets whole wheat matzo, crushed
*   6 large eggs
*   1 cup sugar
*   1 cup raisins
*   1/4 cup orange juice
*   grated zest of one orange
*   1 1/2 Tbsp. cinnamon
*   6 tart apples, peeled, cored, and sliced

1.  Preheat oven to 350F. Grease a 9”x12” baking pan.
2.  Cover crushed matzo with warm water, then drain and squeeze out water.
3.  Mix eggs, sugar, raisins, orange juice, zest, and cinnamon. Add soaked matzo, then stir in sliced apples.
4.  Pour batter into greased pan. Bake 45 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
