# Psychology & UX (Sean Higgins, Northeastern)

* Designers have perhaps co-opted psychology without the background, principles
  * Signs
    * UX teams without any UX researchers (shortage of researchers and mentors)
    * More people are "doing UX" but less _user-centric_ design is being done
* Do small test samples obviate need for rigorous testing?
  * Science demands statistical significance
  * Can we craft an appropriate form of research?
* How do we create symbiotic relationship between _scientists_ and _designers_?
* Are heuristics/checklists distracting people from engaging in research first?
  * This would be "design-centered design," not "user-centered design"
* We need to balance the art & science

# Ethical implications of the chatbox user experience (Jennifer Siegel, Bentley)

* Inspiration? Humans love yelling at robots.
  * 2001: AOL "SmarterChild" bot... users take out frustrations verbally
  * Do we take this behavior for granted?
* 10-15% of interactions with "conversational agents" are abusive
  * Given exponential increase of interactions, that's a serious number
* Can we understand the human behaviors that chatbots expose?
* Hedonomics vs. Schadenfreude
  * Hedonomics: Creating delightful human technology
  * Schadenfreude: Joy when learning of pain of another
      * Research: When your rival team fails, your reward center triggers
* Maybe being mean _to a robot_ isn't a big deal?
  * Research: venting does not reduce emotion, **it normalizes it**.
  * Also: we can offend those who overhear us
  * Children learn from mirroring
    * Baby learns iPad easily, but then tries to interact with magazine by taping, swiping, etc.
    * We're not designed to process conversation in different ways... e.g. person vs. Alexa
* Significant implications for gender dynamics
  * Many virtual assistants are female
  * Culture identifies warmth, kindness with female voices
  * Could reinforce notion of women as subservient
  * Female avatars receive more harrassment than male avatars
* How do chatbots respond to abuse?
  * Many try to use humor to brush it off ("I'd blush if I could")
  * Google Home doesn't engage with abusive messages ("I don't understand")
  * Potential to directly confront abusive user: "I will not tolerate, here's a link to learn more"
* Recomemndations
  * More diverse teams, personas
  * Reinforce that chatbots are not human
  * More research into chatbot interactions affecting real-world behavior
  * Identify the broader-reaching impacts, "the larger user experience"
    * Design chatbots that defend those who can't defend themselves

# Brand in the age of UX & IxD (Hoshedar Bamji)

* Brand - think color, type... but a lot more
* Great brands have character, personality, associated values
  * experiences/associations with organization's products, services, identity
* UX process doesn't typically include step for "brand"
* Design thinking, too... how will experience affect the brand?
* In tech today, teams are smaller, have faster cycles
  * Less capacity to consider brand?
  * UX has become the "brand"
* Need to consider offline & long-term online engagement
* Success of new experience = past experience + new expectations
* Orangina
  * associated with shaking motion (because it has pulp)
  * now incorporating shaking experience into other user experiences: advertising, dispensers, "loading" designs, hover feedback (microinteractions)
