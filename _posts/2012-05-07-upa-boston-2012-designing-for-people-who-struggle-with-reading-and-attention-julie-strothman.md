_At the UPA Boston 2012 conference, Julie Strothman presented “Designing for People Who Struggle with Reading and Attention.” As is frequently the case when targetting users with literacy/attention needs, these changes will improve usability for all users._

“[Slides](http://strottrot.com/2012/05/09/designing-for-people-who-struggle-with-reading-and-attention/)

*   Started with a great example of how hard it is for some people to decode text and avoid distractions.
*   Move beyond “don’t make me thing,” to “don’t make me work harder than I already have to”
*   Eye tracking between fluent readers and those who struggle (e.g. dyslexic) show dramatic difference - far more, and longer, pauses on syllables; more regression to previous words/lines
*   “getting 10 minutes more to take a test” doesn’t approach the amount of extra effort required

(Jon spaces out for a few minutes - sends an e-mail…)

### SUPPORT ATTENTION RECOVERY

*   let users recognize what they need to do, rather than recall it
*   for example, show the password rules on login form
*   BagCheck login lets you look up your name to see what third-party service you used for login (on social site, it’s okay to see lists of user names, and is very helpful)
*   Stop using dismissible error messages, show the error messages in context. Otherwise, hard to remember all the errors when you go back to fix.

### PROVIDE HINTS INLINE

*   vocabulary tooltips, further explanation

### GUESS WHEN POSSIBLE

*   some struggling users don’t like to read, so they try to guess without reading
*   following patterns is huge help

### FAQs AS EARLY FALLBACK

*   some users go straight to FAQ, since they expect questions to have been asked, or to find a phone number there easily

### STOP CAPTCHA MADNESS

*   things that make understanding hard for machines (visual distortion, background noise) make it especially hard for struggling users to decipher
*   strugglers spend lots of extra times looking around the page for clues - don’t put in unnecessary stuff that would be distracting

### SEARCH WITH AUTOSUGGEST

*   help people spell
*   help people narrow down search automatically
*   use search logs to identify good choices for “best bets”
*   show spelling alternatives for frequent spelling mistakes

### USE PLAIN LANGUAGE

*   use simple words, active voice, reduce use of prepositional phrases
*   see plainlanguage.gov (not “accordingly”, rather “so”)
*   active voice is much easier to parse than passive voice!
*   prepositional phrase: “the tool that is most efficient”, simplified: “the most efficient tool”
*   avoid ALL CAPS - when you’re decoding words, you get a lot of info from the ascenders and descenders”
