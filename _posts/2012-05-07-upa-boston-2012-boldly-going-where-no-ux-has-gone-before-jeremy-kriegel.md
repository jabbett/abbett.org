_Jeremy Kriegel presented “Boldly Going Where No UX Has Gone Before” at the UPA Boston Conference on May 7, 2012._

Forget about UX tools, think about team value: What does team need most to be successful now?

### FREQUENT REVISIONS

*   “I can create wireframes faster than your guys can code.”
*   In 2-3 days, we could get the wireframes done, and have a review.
*   In a week, we had gone through more revisions than the developers could do with code in two months.
*   Then UX was swamped with new work ;)

### AUDIENCE UNCERTAINTY

*   In one of his markets, French government started regulating.
*   Now people have to submit a picture of a government document (e.g. social security card) to sign up.
*   Existing customers had to re-sign! If product didn’t get sign-up flow right, company would lose all their customers.
*   Cultural diferences to privacy, security – how do you test in US for users in France? Gonna have to go to France, find some of their users there, test with them.
*   Can’t change the rules, but can test the UI so that it works best within constraints.
*   If you can present something as a risk, rather than a benefit, it can be more convincing – “push the risk.”
*   Finding the right message to convince the stakeholders, is very important – that’s why he’s a better advocate now than before.
*   Identifying the risk makes spending the money look insignificant – justify the value in stakeholder’s terms

### USER KNOWLEDGE

*   Product team didn’t know what happened once product had been installed.
*   Hard to make decisions in a vacuum.
*   Ideally: tell product owner, let’s spend next three weeks on the road, watching users. But no way that would happen.
*   More practical: Let’s spend one day a month talking to a customer.
*   **It’s low-friction…** not huge benefit with one meeing, but it gets foot in the door, and after a few months, you’ve built up a lot of knowledge.
*   Plus the monthly schedule meant the knowledge could evolve, wouldn’t get stale like lots of interviews all at once.

### TAKING THE NEXT STEP

*   When you start, there’s a bit of expectation that things might change
*   But after you’ve begun, change levels off… need to keep “bumping” for more change
*   _What’s the next important need in company that UX can address_
*   Jeremy’s progression: Started with mostly wireframes, prototypes; then identified risk of losing customers, a bump that let them start usability testing, then could move into other areas of the product…

### PREPARING YOURSELF

*   Inertia may make it tough to make change
*   How do you prepare to address barriers? What’s their appetite for change? Need to find out directly.
*   Ask: why haven’t they had UX? how do they expect the org to change? where is UX on the priority list?
*   Note: Most hiring managers haven’t thought about these question.
*   Maybe when push comes to shove, they don’t want to make the changes necessary to address UX concerns.
*   Sometimes people value UX, but it’s low on the priority list.
*   Is delivering on time, on budget, new features most important? What’s driving the company?

### JEREMY’S BIAS

*   Very much a collaborator, his personal style.
*   Lower friction activities. Simple things he can control, show value quickly.
*   Use the trust that builds to push for bigger things.
*   “Driving the UX wedge” – keep hammering to provide more value
*   Delivering value to the team, not “doing the best design in the world”
*   “What is the next most important problem the business has that UX can help solve?”

### QUESTIONS

*   “How do I design in the absence of usability tests / user input?”
*   Best practices: what works generically, based on research, personal experience, common sense, what’s out there on the web.
*   Look for key assumptions that you’re making: if you’re wrong, you’re screwed. That’s the risk, you can present that to others and challenge them on it. If we’re wrong, there’s a big impact; here’s what I think we’d need to do to learn the right answer.
