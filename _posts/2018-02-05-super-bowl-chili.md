This recipe benefits from the slow building of flavor from whole, traditional ingredients.

* * *

*   1 Tbsp cumin seeds
*   6 large cloves garlic, skin on
*   4 dried ancho chilis
*   4 Tbsp olive oil
*   2 C chopped white onion (1 large)
*   1/2 tsp. salt
*   1 C tomato puree
*   28 oz. fire roasted tomatoes
*   28 oz. crushed tomatoes
*   29 oz. dark red kidney beans

*   Minced jalapeno or habanero to taste

1.  Toast cumin seeds, grind, and set aside.
2.  Toast garlic on a grill or cast iron pan, until skins are black. Peel, chop, and set aside.
3.  Cover the chilis with boiling water and let soak until soft (about 15 minutes).
4.  Chop chilis roughly, discarding seeds, and place in blender or food processor with enough soaking liquid to puree properly.
5.  Heat olive oil in a 5.5-quart dutch oven. Fry chili puree until quite thick and fragrant.
6.  Add cumin, onions, and salt. Sweat onions for 5-10 minutes until softened.
7.  Add tomato puree, scraping up chili paste from bottom of pan.
8.  Add chopped garlic, remaining tomatoes, and kidney beans. Bring to a simmer.
9.  Meanwhile, brown the beef and add to the simmering pot.
10.  Cook at a gentle bubble for an hour or two. Adjust seasoning with extra jalape√±o or habanero.
