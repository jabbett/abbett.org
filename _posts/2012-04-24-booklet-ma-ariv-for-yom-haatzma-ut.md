This year, [our community](http://yibrookline.org/) is adopting the Israeli _nusach tefilah_ for [Yom HaAtzma’ut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Ha'atzmaut). As only [Koren Publishers](http://www.korenpub.com/EN/index.php) includes this in their prayerbooks, and we’re not ready to start replacing our [Artscroll _siddurim_](http://www.artscroll.com/Books/srca.html), I have compiled and typeset the necessary texts for Wednesday night’s evening service in a handy booklet.

I have long felt that there ought to be more free and open _siddur_ materials, so in that spirit, I am offering it for download with a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license.

*   [Ma’ariv for Yom HaAtzma’ut (PDF, Booklet Page Order)](http://abbett.org/assets/downloads/YomHaAtzmautBooklet.pdf)
*   [Ma’ariv for Yom HaAtzma’ut (DavkaWriter)](http://abbett.org/assets/downloads/YomHaAtzmaut.dwd)

The booklet is made for printing on 8.5”×11” paper in landscape orientation to be folded and saddle-stitched. I find that bringing a specimen with me to Staples can be very helpful to explain the right-to-left Hebrew orientation. At this time, the booklet’s text is Hebrew with English headings and instructions. In the future, I would like to produce a version with a full English translation. (If you would like to offer your own public domain translation of any part, please be in touch.)

The contents are as follows:

*   Psalm 107
*   Psalm 97
*   Psalm 98
*   Three verses excerpted from _L’cha Dodi_
*   The typical Ma’ariv text, minus _Baruch Hashem L’Olam_ before the _Amida_
*   Then, before _Sefirat HaOmer_…
    *   _Sh’ma Yisrael_
    *   _Hashem Hu Elokim_
    *   _Mi she’asa nissim_ from _Birkat HaChodesh_
    *   Numbers chapter 10, verses 9-10
    *   A tekiah gedolah, followed by _L’shana haba’a birushalayim hab’nuya_
    *   _Y’hi ratzon… shek’sheim shezachinu…_
    *   Psalm 126
*   _Sefirat HaOmer_
*   _Aleinu_
*   _Ani Ma’amin_
*   _Kaddish Yatom_
