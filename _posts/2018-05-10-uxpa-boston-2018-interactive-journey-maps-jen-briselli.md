* Specifically, making journey maps interactive
* Tools, platforms, methods, tutorials out there... but what's right for our project/client/need?
	* no one singular solution
	* we make deliverables from scratch, to serve our needs best

## Some definitions

### Maps

* Maps do a lot of things
	* Where are we?
	* Where do we want to go?
	* What's the route to get there?
	* How do we navigate along the way?
		* Track my path, give me feedback
* ...but interactivity helps maps _do those things better_.

### "Journey maps"

* At its most basic: some kind of visual artifact that illustrates a path or journey
	* A user, customer and steps/actions/experiences over time
	* Then layered with other information...
	  * Thoughts, emotations, **qualitative** experience
	  * What channels? Touchpoints? Interactions?
	  * Behind-the-scenes operational/employee actions?
	  * Data/infrastructure/algorithms
* Can show both current-state as well as future-state

### "Interactivity"

* Does not mean "just make something digital"
  * e.g. first wave of newspapers going online
* Adding an interactive component enhances it, helps make meaning, increase understanding, draws relationships/connections

## Two examples

### Financial customer experience

* Financial company wanted to reenvision entire customer experience
* End-to-end experience research, strategy, and design, including...
	* Internal stakeholder research
	* Customer & employee interviews
	* Generated design principles to guide future phases
	* Behavioral archetypes (vs. traditional personas)
	* Core concepts, key moments in ideal experience
* How do we incorporate all that into the customer's end-to-end journey?
* Journey map included...
	* Experience steps
	* Digital "front-of-house" elements
	* People-based "front-of-house" elements
	* Technical "backstage" implications
* Iterated internally... it was huge: a 40-foot journey map!
	* In 2018, stuff is complex!
	* But size makes it hard to use... posted on wall internally, and with client during collaborative sessions
	* In large meeting, it's OK, but when it's done, can't make it a simple poster
* So... make it interactive!

#### An linear, interactive journey map

* Not super fancy, but useful!
* Not just a "static PDF" of the giant map
* Allow people to jump from phase to phase, section to section
	* Not always one path, more like choose-your-own-adventure
* Includes enhanced content... highlight big opportunities to improve customer experience
	* Link to additional detail, sketches, prototypes, recommendations
* Pull your research into the strategy deliverable, so it doesn't languish in a research report
  * Provide rationale for an experience right there in the interactive map
* Zoom in to look more closely on what you're interested in
  * Executive can socialize the vision with the birds-eye-view
  * Designer can zoom in on detail for each component

### Health experience ecosystem

* Evaluate an existing "health experience ecosystem"... chronic condition (like asthma), align all data swimming around us
  * Devices, weather
  * Put it together to serve the patient, help them manage condition
* Started with an "ecosystem" map from client... but just a list of parts... very little meaning/connections
* The more we mapped relationships, we realized we need to see in context of a dynamic (non-linear) journey
  * Chronic condition management is ongoing, no end
  * Shift between equilibrium, and being knocked-out of equilibrium

#### An circular, interactive journey map

* How do we create a "circular journey"?
  * Even more critical to make it interactive! Where are the potential opportunities to intervene for patient?
* Started with an ugly early draft on paper, then made it interactive
  * Started with an introduction, an onboarding experience, to understand what they're looking at
  * Tool is pretty esoteric... so start with an interactive story
  * Start with patient...
    * then data sources around patient...
    * then where interpretation of data takes place...
    * outer layer is customer experience
      * circular
      * includes highlights of key moments/opportunities
* When you click on a key moment, it highlights the related layers/data in the rest of the map
  * Links out to deep dive with recommendations, additional design deliverables

## Lessons

### Can

* Improve usability of artifact that has a lot of dense information
* Provide unified UX vision to distributed/remote team
* Better highlight (and back up) key opportunities right in context of vision/journey
* Adapt to a customized format that better captures experience and resonates with internal teams
* Scalable, editable, living design
* Tie recommendations to research artifacts/media

### Cannot

* Skip ahead to interactive journey map, without research/strategy process behind it
* Overcome lack of integration with internal teams

## Practical tips

* Don't need fancy tools and software, can do with team and tools you have in house
	* Also, risk that bespoke tool will limit how you implement, decrease your ability to innovate around format
* Provide multiple levels of detail
  * Designers need _detail_
  * Developers need _summary vision_
  * Leadership need _clear/actionable recommendations_
* Think about use cases...
  * Make easier to navigate
  * Access by remote teams
  * Access to details
  * Visualize relationships
* The tool is a UX project in itself
  * Build time into your process to...
    * sketch
    * collaborate with other designers, developers
    * evaluate with target audiences & iterate!
* Think about the content...
  * Figure it out first, then design the map
  * Don't "design the airplane as you fly"
* Don't skip research/strategy phases
* Seek collaboration from stakeholders for buy-in
* Think twice! Not right if...
  * you're a small team with short-term goals
  * you're only mapping status quo
  * you're creating an internal artifact with short shelf life
  * you don't have multiple layers of information to share
