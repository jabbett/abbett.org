I've had a few go-to chocolate chip cookie recipes, but none of then were truly reliable. When the pandemic gave me the opportunity to perfect a cookie recipe, I started with search Serious Eats, and settled on [a "quick and easy" recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/08/bravetart-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe.html) that seemed to have good scientific foundations. I wanted a cookie that spreads well, maintains a rounded edge, stays chewy, and tastes great.

**The note about the temperature of the margarine/butter is key!** I stick a probe thermometer into my margarine until it reads 65°F before starting to mix anything.

_Makes 24 3.5-inch cookies._

### Equipment

* Stand mixer with paddle
* Baking sheet with parchment paper
* Digital scale
* #24 disher

### Ingredients

* 8 oz. chocolate chips
* 355g all-purpose flour
* 2 sticks (225g) unsalted Fleischmann's Margarine or butter, soft but cool, 65°F (18°C)
* 205g white sugar (1 C)
* 225g light brown sugar (1 C, gently packed)
* 15g vanilla extract (1 Tbsp)
* 1/2 tsp. instant espresso powder
* 8g kosher salt (2 tsp. Diamond brand)
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1 large egg (50g), cold from the fridge

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C).
1. Combine flour and chocolate chips, set aside.
1. Combine butter, both sugars, vanilla, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and espresso powder in the bowl of a stand mixer.
1. Mix on low to moisten, then increase to meadium and beat until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.
1. With mixer running, add egg and beat only until smooth.
1. Reduce speed to low and add flour/chocolate mixture all at once. Mix to form a stiff dough.
1. Portion with #24 disher onto parchment-lined baking sheet, 12 cookies per batch.
1. Bake until puffed and pale gold around the edges, about 15 minutes. (For crunchy cookies, bake 3-5 minutes longer.)
1. Cool directly on baking sheet until set, about 5 minutes. Enjoy warm, or move cookies to cooling rack.
