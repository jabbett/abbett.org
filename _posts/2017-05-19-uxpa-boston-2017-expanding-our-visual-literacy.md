*   individual displays, internal presentations, external communications
*   how do you expand communication throughout your enterprise?

*   2-6 displays typical, example shows financial analysts with 12 displays
*   opportunity to provide context to lots and lots of raw financial data

1.  relevant
2.  scan & scrutinize
3.  easy to navigate
4.  show then tell: show first, then tell (combine… don’t take away “their numbers,” but augment them)

*   “get a big picture view, then go into the details”

## the bar chart

*   one time interval (in this case 3 months)
*   select one fund, then look at it over several times interval
*   can we consolodate the historical into the one time period view
*   get a richer picture… is current data point a historical anomoly?
*   make it interactive, let user choose their time interval (e.g. 10 y instead of 3m)

## What makes a graphic encoding work for quant data?

*   looked at accuracy of different encodings (e.g. points on common scale, length of line, angle, area, etc.)
*   also incorporated additional design elements (fg/bg, color pallet, sort order)
*   when you use a less precise techinque (like color saturation) combine with many other design elements to make it effective (in this case, color pallet, grouping, proximity, details on demand, sort order, etc.)
