Thanks to the various blogs and mailing lists I read, I see lots of great recommendations for books on or related to interaction design. Lately, though, they’ve been piling up – too much actual interaction design work to have time to read!

Here’s what in the queue now:

*   _Prototyping: A Practitioner’s Guide_ by Todd Zaki Warfel
*   _The Designful Company_ by Marty Neumeier
*   _Designers Don’t Read_ by Austin Howe
*   _Thinking with Type_ by Ellen Lupton

Currently in progress:

*   _Nudge_ by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler
*   _CSS Mastery_ by Andy Budd

Need to go back and reread more thoroughly:

*   _Sketching User Experiences_ by Bill Buxton
*   _Designing for the Digital Age_ by Kim Goodwin
