Despite the far-right’s scaremongering about “death panels,” end-of-life issues are critically important. There are many kinds of [advance health care directives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_health_care_directive), but probably the easiest and most universally necessary document is a [health care proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_proxy), which specifies who should make decisions about your medical care should you become unable to do so.

In Massachusetts, it’s super easy. Print this form, fill out at least the second page, and have two witnesses sign it (I asked two colleagues here in the office).

Then, make sure it’s easy to access by loved ones, healthcare professionals, or other important people in your life. I have [posted mine here](/assets/downloads/JonathanAbbettHealthCareProxy.PDF).
