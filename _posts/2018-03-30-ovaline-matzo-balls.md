We like matzo balls that are quite tender but hold their shape well – no “golf balls” at our table. The quennelle techinque makes for an elegant ovaline shape.

* * *

*   3 eggs, separated
*   3/4 C matzo meal
*   1 tsp. kosher salt
*   2 tsp. chopped parsley (optional)

1.  Boil a pot of salted water. (Best to have the water boiling before you continue.)
2.  Whip the egg whites until you have almost-stiff peaks.
3.  Mix the egg yolks, matzo meal, salt, and parsley until it resembles wet sand. (I rub between my hands to get it well distributed.)
4.  Fold the egg whites into the matzo meal mixture. Be gentle but make sure it’s blended thoroughly.
5.  Using two tablespoons, [form quennelles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVTKy5r0KKo) with the matzo ball mix and drop into the (gently!) boiling water. Make sure your quennelles are pressed tight, so they maintain their shape in the boiling water.
6.  Simmer for 30 minutes. They will double in size. Drain with a slotted spoon.
7.  Serve immediately in delicious chicken soup or chill until you’re ready to eat.

Makes 12 ovaline matzo balls, serving six people. If you need to make more, prepare them in multiple batches rather than multiplying the recipe.
