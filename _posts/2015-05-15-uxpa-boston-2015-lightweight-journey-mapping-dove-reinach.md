_Laura Dove and Stephen Reinach, UXers at MathWorks, presented at UXPA Boston 2015._

## Background

*   Simulink is a product used to visually code for low-cost computers (i.e. DIY robots, but even as sophisticated as automobiles)
*   To use Simulink, Matlab customers need “hardware support packages”
*   Matlab uses e-mails to inform customers about these packages (links at very bottom of email)
*   Click the link, user goes to a webpage within Matlab site where download starts immediately (in the footer of the browser)
*   Analytics showed 600 link clicks but only 20 installs
*   Maybe users didn’t have the latest version of Matlab?
*   Marketers wanted links to try to sell latest version, instead of direct download
*   Hold on - why don’t we talk to customers to see what their experience was?

## First attempt

*   Face to face interview with someone who tried to install support package
*   While she described process, every so often would ask for 0-10 rating of “pain”
*   At one point she got really stuck, marked it a 10

## What is a journey map?

*   Journey maps have different names: Customer journeys, experience maps, customer journey maps, day-in-the-life
*   what was common: organization was building maps for the customers’ journey (top-down approach); emotional component to the journey; at the end, an information graphic
*   Started with basics: story of customer’s experience, capture emotional response to experiences, goal of teaching org about customers, end with an infographic
*   BUT - customer would drive the process and needed something lightweight (easy to administer, easy to use, but still have an impact)

## Approach to journey mapping they created

*   Force participant to choose only 4 points in their journey
*   Drag and drop interface for choosing emotion (looks awkward?)
*   With journey map created, you can easily focus on future efforts to improve a customer’s experience

## Now, first time they used with customers

*   Each session took about an hour (orientation, background, interview/show-and-tell, two-minute orientation to j-mapping, participant does mapping, participant walks through, debrief)
*   Did five sessions (with external customers)
*   Customer would demonstrate steps while going through process
*   Customers would use end-goals that were beyond what they expected (helped them broaden perspective)
*   Customers use very different language to describe their activities, had to spend time abstracting into summary
*   In the end - got more detail into key steps, more explanation of “why”, more discussion of habits & patterns

## Example result

*   Students didn’t know difference between “opening” a file and “downloading” a file
*   Teacher had to ask students to switch firmwares in the midst of the lab
*   Matlab’s assumption was that tech people would do configuration ahead of time

# Findings

*   Customers were avoiding (“almost frightened”) using e-mail links
*   They preferred to do the download within the product
*   Findings resonated with marketing people (though they didn’t quite understand importance of interview portion of process), then brought to upper level management
*   Considered removing ability to download from web, tell users to start process within the product
*   Management wanted to learn more, now in midst of a root-cause analysis

# Follow-up

*   better face diagrams for showing easy/frustrating”
